/**
 * The live tool catalog the Denied Tools panel renders.
 *
 * A web client plugin cannot enumerate the Host's tools: the session remote exposes
 * session/model/skill methods only, and `configForms` exposes this plugin's own config.
 * The catalog therefore travels through that config: a volatile field the Host serves
 * through `settings.describe()` and every open web client mirrors. The plugin commits it
 * in memory — the same reference protocol the Loader uses for a volatile write — and then
 * announces `settings/document-updated`, the event the client-side settings mirror already
 * refreshes on.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the profile file: a settings edit writes only the paths it names,
 * and the panel only ever names `deniedTools` / `allowedTools`. Because the commit does
 * not go through the Loader, it also never emits `loader/volatile-update`, so refreshing
 * the catalog cannot reinstall every main agent's mask.
