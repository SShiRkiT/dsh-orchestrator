/**
 * The main-agent gate. Dependency-free, so the whole gate can be tested without
 * the DSH runtime.
 *
 * The gate is whitelist-driven: only the tools named by the live Allowed Tools list
 * stay available to a main agent, and every other tool the host offers — a built-in
 * tool, a tool another plugin registered, an MCP tool loaded after this plugin, and
 * even a tool that does not exist yet — is hidden and refused. The shipped default is
 * `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_TOOLS` in `lib/index.js`; a profile may replace it with any set,
 * and an empty set means the main agent gets nothing at all.
 *
 * The gate follows the dispatch switch instead of the moment an agent was created:
 * the guard is installed for every top-level agent and reads `enabled()` on each
 * call, so turning the switch on in an already open conversation takes effect at
 * once. Hiding is a separate, reversible step, re-applied from the live list whenever
 * the config or the registry changes (`refresh`), because the host stores the names a
 * restriction was installed with instead of re-reading them on every request.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because one is not enough:
 * - `tools.restrict` hides a tool from the agent, but only for GLOBAL tools. It throws
 *   `tools.restrict() names unknown global tool "x"` for a tool registered in the agent's
 *   own scope, which is where DSH registers the native `subagent` tool. A throw leaves the
 *   tool visible and callable, so hiding alone cannot make the gate real.
 * - `tools.guard` takes a synchronous predicate over an attempted execution and applies to
 *   the agent's own scope too, so a scope-local tool such as `subagent`, and any shell tool
 *   that could write files, can be refused at call time. It also covers calls nested inside
 *   `run_code`.
 *
 * Every name is allow-listed, the two delegation tools included: the panel offers the whole
 * catalog, only the checked names stay callable, and the guard refuses exactly what the
 * whitelist leaves out.
 *
 * One name needs more than a name check. `run_code` is the PTC transport: it is the one
 * tool a main agent may call directly, it cannot be restricted, and hiding it would hide
 * `tools.delegate` with it. It is therefore never part of the hidden set; the guard lets
 * it through unless the panel checks it explicitly, and reads the call's own arguments
 * instead — see `run-code-guard.js` for the two escapes it closes (a sandbox escalation
 * on the call, and a program that reaches the Node.js runtime instead of going through
 * `tools.*`).

 * plain array too, for tests and callers without a live config. While the switch is off the
 * guard lets everything through and lifts any earlier restriction; while it is on the gate
 * hides every name the whitelist does not cover and refuses a call to one at execution
 * time, which is what covers scope-local tools such as `subagent`. A guard failure is
 * reported, not thrown: a broken gate must not break agent creation.
 *
 * The hidden set is computed from `catalog()` plus whatever the agent's own scope view
 * shows, so a new plugin or MCP tool that registers after this agent was created is hidden
 * as soon as something calls `refresh()` — which is why `lib/index.js` refreshes on
 * `tools/change`, not only on a settings write.
 *
 * Hiding is a mask the host stores, not a predicate it calls: the tool registry evaluates
 * every restriction on every model request, but it evaluates the names it was given when
 * `restrict()` ran. A panel write or a late registration therefore changes nothing the
 * model sees until the mask is replaced, which is what `refresh()` does — lift the old
 * handles first, then install the current set, so repeated calls never accumulate
 * restrictions. `dispose()` removes the mask and the guard together.
