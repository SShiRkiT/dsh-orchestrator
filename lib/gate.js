/**
 * The main-agent gate. Dependency-free, so the whole gate can be tested without
 * the DSH runtime.
 *
 * The gate follows the dispatch switch instead of the moment an agent was created:
 * the guard is installed for every top-level agent and reads `enabled()` on each
 * call, so turning the switch on in an already open conversation takes effect at
 * once. Hiding is a separate, reversible step, re-applied from the live list whenever
 * the config changes (`refresh`), because the host stores the names a restriction was
 * installed with instead of re-reading them on every request.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because one is not enough:
 * - `tools.restrict` hides a tool from the agent, but only for GLOBAL tools. It throws
 *   `tools.restrict() names unknown global tool "x"` for a tool registered in the agent's
 *   own scope, which is where DSH registers the native `subagent` tool. A throw leaves the
 *   tool visible and callable, so hiding alone cannot make the gate real.
 * - `tools.guard` takes a synchronous predicate over an attempted execution and applies to
 *   the agent's own scope too, so a scope-local tool such as `subagent`, and any shell tool
 *   that could write files, can be refused at call time. It also covers calls nested inside
 *   `run_code`.
 *
 * Every name is deniable, the two delegation tools included: the panel offers the whole
 * catalog and the guard refuses exactly what the profile denies.
 *
 * One name needs more than a name check. `run_code` is the PTC transport: it is the only
 * tool a main agent may call directly, it cannot be restricted, and hiding it would hide
 * `tools.delegate` with it. So while the gate denies anything at all, the guard also reads
 * the call's own arguments — see `run-code-guard.js` for the two escapes it closes (a
 * sandbox escalation on the call, and a program that reaches the Node.js runtime instead of
 * going through `tools.*`).
