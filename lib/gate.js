/**
 * The main-agent gate: the execution-time half of the whitelist. Dependency-free, so the
 * whole gate can be tested without the DSH runtime.
 *
 * The gate is whitelist-driven: only the tools named by the live Allowed Tools list stay
 * available to a main agent. The model-facing half lives in `lib/tool-surface.js`, which
 * filters `tools.definitions()` — the one call a request's tool declarations and prompt
 * blocks are built from. This module is what makes the whitelist real when the model asks
 * anyway: `tools.guard` runs before a tool body and refuses every name the list leaves out,
 * including the scope-local tools `tools.restrict` cannot hide (the native `subagent`, every
 * `ops_*` tool) and calls nested inside `run_code`.
 *
 * Why no `tools.restrict` here any more: every restriction (and every dispose) announces
 * `tools/change`, and `dsh-ops` reacts to that event by clearing its official
 * `read`/`glob`/`grep` shadows and re-installing them from an async retry queue. A main
 * agent's ~30 restrictions therefore fanned out into a mask storm, and a request assembled
 * in the window saw a table that gained and lost three tools — rewriting the cached prompt
 * prefix twice. The surface wrapper is event-free, so the guard is all that is left.
 *
 * The gate follows the dispatch switch instead of the moment an agent was created: it is
 * installed for every top-level agent and reads `enabled()` on each call, so turning the
 * switch on in an already open conversation takes effect at once.
 *
 * Every name is allow-listed, the two delegation tools included: the panel offers the whole
 * catalog, only the checked names stay callable, and the guard refuses exactly what the
 * whitelist leaves out.
 *
 * One name needs more than a name check. `run_code` is the PTC transport: it is the one
 * tool a main agent may call directly, and dropping it would take `tools.delegate` with it.
 * The guard lets it through unless the panel checks it explicitly, and reads the call's own
 * arguments instead — see `run-code-guard.js` for the two escapes it closes (a sandbox
 * escalation on the call, and a program that reaches the Node.js runtime instead of going
 * through `tools.*`).

 * deepen the depth, never lower it. A dirty value (negative, fractional, NaN, a
 * string) is treated as absent instead of throwing, because a throw inside the
