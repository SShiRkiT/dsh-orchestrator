/**
 * The model-facing tool surface. Everything a request carries about tools — the `tools`
 * declaration array, the executor's own sections and a plugin's prompt blocks such as
 * `# Bash command execution: ops_bash` — is built from one host call:
 * `tools.definitions(scope, toolSet)`. Wrapping that call is therefore the only place a
 * mask can be both complete and quiet.
 *
 * Complete, because `tools.restrict` only hides INHERITED (global) tools. A tool a plugin
 * registers in the agent's own scope — every `ops_*` tool, the native `subagent` — stays
 * visible unconditionally, and `restrict` throws `unknown global tool` for it.
 *
 * Quiet, because every `restrict`/dispose pair announces `tools/change`, and listeners
 * react by churning the table: `dsh-ops` clears the official `read`/`glob`/`grep` shadows
 * on that event and re-installs them from an async retry queue (25/100/400/1000 ms). A
 * request assembled inside that window saw the official tools, the next one saw them gone:
 * the table gained 3 and lost 3, the cached prompt prefix was rewritten twice, and the
 * conversation cache was lost with it.
 *
 * The wrapper reads the live whitelist (main agent) or a fixed deny list (delegated child)
 * at request time, so a panel write or a switch flip applies from the very next request
 * without a single event. It also shadows the official `read`/`glob`/`grep` as soon as
 * their `dsh-ops` replacement is registered — the state the async hide queue is heading to
 * — so the transient leak never reaches a request.
